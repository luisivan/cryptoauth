5. the server replies with a token encrypted using the user's pubkey. it has linked that token with the user pubkey

6. the browser unencrypts it, signs the token using the user's privkey and sends only the signature and a hash of the pubkey it to the server

7. the server verifies the signature coupling it to the token and logs the user in. the token used before could also be used as the session secret

(hashed pubkey + encrypted token) + (token's signature)
0.6kb + 0.4kb = 1kb

2.5kb + 1.5kb = 4kb
